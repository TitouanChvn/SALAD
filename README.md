# SALAD
SALAD is a python program that simulate a dialog between man and machine.


SALAD takes input from user in the command line, process it to choose an appropriate response, and prints it's response in the command line.

It uses a "source.txt" file to decide the right response.

SALAD can be used to create a chatbot on a webside. You can get an exemple in my flask web application (link) (comming soon)
